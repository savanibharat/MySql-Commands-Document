MySql-Commands-Document
=======================

This repository constains commands for SQL executed in MySql 5.6

Some of this commands won't work in MS SQL SERVER or ORACLE as syntax is differentfor different database vendors.

Also few commands wont work in MySql 5.1 as some syntax has changed when MySql 5.6 was released.

But still MySql 5.1 is stable release.
